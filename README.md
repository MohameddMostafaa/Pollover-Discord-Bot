# Description

A Discord bot made using Python that allows users to create polls on Discord servers in which users can then vote for the option they want via a dropdown menu. The bot can also fetch random trivia questions from [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/) and users can guess the correct answer for the question.

The bot is hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/@MohameddMostafa/Pollover-Bot).
